# Data audit for contractors' submittal


## Description
In 2021, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas approved a consent decree,which demands City of Houston to clean all of waste water treatment and operation facilities, between the City of Houston, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of Texas to improve Houston's wastewater system.

Contractors are required to submit data before and after cleaning. The data includes excel, access database, GIS shapefile, video and pdf report.
My role in this project is to review, analyze and audit the data qaulity.

More specifically,I created several scripts for this project.
   * Iterate entire directory and generate a list of submitted items, including item folders, required files (excel, access, GIS, video and pdf)
   * Perform data analysis in python including data cleaning, data merging, data validation and data conversion.
   * Manipulate content and tables from word doc, excel, and pdf.
